#Google Cast module for Connect SDK (iOS)
The Google Cast module extends Connect SDK to add Google Cast SDK support. This repository is included as a submodule in the main project, and has some manual setup before the main project will compile.

3. Move the framework bundle into your `modules/google-cast/` directory
4. **In your project**: link `GoogleCast.framework` with your application target:

  * *or* go to your project settings, select the application target, "Build Phases" tab, in "Link Binary With Libraries" section click "+", then "Add Otherâ€¦", and select the framework file

###Connect SDK Lite Integration
1. Clone this repository into a subfolder of the Connect SDK Lite project
